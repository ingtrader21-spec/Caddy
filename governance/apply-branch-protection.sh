# Apply the canonical protection for the Caddy promotion chain:
#
#   feature/* -> development -> test -> staging -> production -> main
#
# Run through .github/workflows/apply-branch-protection.yml, which supplies a
# repository-administration token and archives the read-back as evidence.
#
# Three earlier defects are called out so they are not reintroduced:
#
#   1. required_approving_review_count was 0 on every branch, including main.
#      That is weaker than config/github/main-ruleset.json, which requires one
#      approval, and it left `production` -- the approved release source -- as
#      the least protected branch in the repository.
#
#   2. The required contexts "exact-head-validation" and
#      "merge-result-validation" are reported by no workflow. The jobs in
#      validate.yml are named "validate-source" and "validate-merge-result".
#      Requiring a context that never reports leaves a branch permanently
#      unmergeable rather than protected.
#
#   3. The payload sent dismissal_restrictions and bypass_pull_request_allowances.
#      GitHub rejects both on a user-owned repository with
#      "Only organization repositories can have users and team restrictions"
#      (HTTP 422), so the script could not have succeeded here at all.
#
# Every context below was observed reporting on real pull requests into the
# branch it is required for.
